# BeInRide
Rest Api build with express js, mongodb & redis
## Introduction
 Transportation is a major issue in our world today. Carpooling is a solution to the problems of traffic jams, pollution, and extra use of fuel.
 Our application is an attempt to make a system which is user friendly and provides an opportunity to share cars. The service will allow users to offer and request ride sharing journeys.
 The main problem in carpooling is how to find out who travels to the same destination as yours every day or who is interested in carpooling. Carpooling allows a large number of passengers and drivers to be matched with each other automatically and instantly wishing to travel to the same destination. Using this developed android application car owners can create a ride by giving information like source, destination, starting time of journey, available seats etc. And ride seekers will be able to search and browse the rides by providing inputs like source, destination, and time. The dynamic Carpooling system relies on the information from two users i.e. ride creator or car owner and ride seeker.
